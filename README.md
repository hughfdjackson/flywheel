## Flywheel

Flywheel is a micro-lib (maybe even micro-micro lib) for making animation- and game-loops, implementing HTML5's RequestAnimationFrame while maintaining backwards compatibility.

    ender build flywheel

You're very welcome to [test it yourself](http://hughfdjackson.github.com/flywheel/src-test/SpecRunner.html).  If you're feeling particularly generous, you could even drop me a line to tell me if there are any problems, or if there's another webbrowser I can add to the compatibility list!
